#/lib

This directory is where all our extra PHP goes. `functions.php` should be a
list of includes that point to here.

##/helpers

This file is for any small functions that aren't suited for being wrapped in
their own individual classes.

##Naming convention

All files should be named using camelCase with the first letter being
lower-case. All classes should be individual files prepended with 'Class'.
