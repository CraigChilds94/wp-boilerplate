#WP Boilerplate
###by Jake Cleary

This is a simple theme setup that I'll use as a boilerplate for any standard
Wordpress projects.

**Including the following:**

* Base files containing the bare minimum markup to reduce deletions
* A simple, consistant folder structure for assets
* A `package.json` for any development dependency management
* A `bower.json` files for managing front-end dependencies
* A `gulpfile.js` for handling:
    * SASS to CSS concantination/minification
    * JS concantination/minification
    * Image optimisation
* A few of plugins that are present in any of my WP projects, such as:
    * [Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf)
    * [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/)
    * [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/)
