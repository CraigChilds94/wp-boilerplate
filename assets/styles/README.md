#/assets/styles

This the is the directory for any SCSS files.

##/modules

Any SCSS that doesn't directly output CSS goes here.

##/partials

SCSS that directly outputs CSS should be split up into files with single
responsibilities and placed here.

##/vendor

Self contained 3rd party stylesheets go here - unless they can me managed
using Bower of course. ;)
