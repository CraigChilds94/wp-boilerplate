#/assets/img

This is where all the theme's images go.

##Naming convention

Consider following the following
naming convention:

* Append background images with `bg_`
* Append logos with `lg_`
* Append slides with `sl_`

All files names should be written in camelCase, with the first letter
being lowercase.

##Sprites

Sprites will actually be folders containing individual images for each sprite
element. **Compass** will be used to build the sprite images and place them in
the /public/img directory. Compass will handle outputting sprite coordinates in
the CSS.
